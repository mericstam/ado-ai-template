**CRITICAL - READ THIS CAREFULLY**:

If files are listed above, you MUST read them BEFORE implementing:

1. Use the Read tool on each file path listed above
2. **WHEN DESCRIBING IMAGES: ONLY describe what you LITERALLY SEE in the image pixels. IGNORE the work item description, title, and all other context. The work item text may be WRONG about what the image contains.**
3. PDFs: Read the actual content, don't assume based on context
4. **DO NOT HALLUCINATE** - If you haven't used the Read tool on a file, you don't know what's in it
5. **VERIFY**: After reading an image, ask yourself: "Am I describing what I actually see, or what I expect to see based on context?"

## Instructions

1. **Review any attachments** - screenshots, diagrams, specs may guide implementation
2. Implement the changes according to the approved analysis
3. Follow coding standards and patterns in the codebase
4. Add appropriate tests
5. Ensure all quality gates pass

## After Implementation

Summarize what was done:
- Which files were changed
- Which tests were added
- Any deviations from the plan
